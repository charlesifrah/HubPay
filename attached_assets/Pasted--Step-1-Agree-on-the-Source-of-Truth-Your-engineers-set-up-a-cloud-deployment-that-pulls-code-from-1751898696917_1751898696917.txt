✨ Step 1: Agree on the Source of Truth
Your engineers set up a cloud deployment that pulls code from GitHub (not Replit directly).

You also point your Replit project to that GitHub repo.
→ Everyone works from the same source of truth: the repo.

✨ Step 2: Agree on a Branching Strategy
Here’s a simple example:

Branch	Purpose
main	stable, production-ready, what the cloud deploys
develop (optional)	staging, where all tested PRs land
feature/*	your new features
security/*	engineers’ hardening/config changes

This ensures:

You work in a feature/ branch.

They work in a security/ branch.

Nobody pushes straight to main.

✨ Step 3: Your Development Flow
Whenever you want to build a new feature:
1️⃣ Make sure your repo is up to date:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
2️⃣ Create a new feature branch off main:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
3️⃣ Build & test your feature in Replit (or locally).

4️⃣ Commit & push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add xyz feature"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
5️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into main (or develop, if your team uses it).
6️⃣ Engineers review → test → merge → deploy.

✨ Step 4: Engineers’ Flow
They also branch off main:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b security/hardening-firewall
Make security & infra changes.

Test in staging.

PR into main when ready.

✨ Step 5: Avoid Conflicts
Here’s how you minimize conflicts:
✅ Always start your branch from the latest main:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
✅ If your branch lives for more than a day or two, periodically sync it:

bash
Copy
Edit
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
or

bash
Copy
Edit
git rebase origin/main`
✅ Before you open a PR, make sure it merges cleanly into main.

✅ Never both work directly on main.

🚀 The Deployment Pipeline
You → build features → feature branch → PR → merge → ready.

Engineers → build security/infra → security branch → PR → merge → ready.

Deployment happens from main.

📋 TL;DR CHECKLIST
✅ You:

Always create & work on feature branches.

Push to GitHub regularly.

Open PRs when ready.

✅ Engineers:

Work in their own branches.

Merge & deploy when tested.

✅ Together:

Never work directly on main.

Keep branches short-lived.

Communicate before merging big changes.

📌 Example Timeline
Time	You	Engineers
Day 1	Start feature/user-dashboard	Start security/add-CSP-headers
Day 2	Push & test feature	Test security changes
Day 3	Merge feature PR	Merge security PR
Day 4	Both now in main → deployed
